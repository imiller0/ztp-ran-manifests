- The [site_gen.sh](https://github.com/redhat-ztp/ztp-ran-manifests/blob/main/site_gen.sh) script takes 2 parameters with the following order: 
    - Cluster_name (your cluster name)
        - Note: the cluste name should match the cluster name you used with ACM manifest.
    - Profile (which profile you want to apply to your cluster. It is either cu or du)
        - Note: the cluste profile should match the cluster profile you used with ACM manifest.

- After executing the site_gen.sh script you will find a directory created under the manifest/sites/{with_YOUR_CLUSTER_NAME}.

- You need to modify the complianceType/spec section in the 04_sriov_network_node_policy.yaml file under manifest/sites/{with_YOUR_CLUSTER_NAME} with the intf name and type that match your cluster nodes.
